/* This program is to output a random phone number 
 * To Use the function please follow the following steps 
 * 
 * step 1 : copy the file phone.h to the isl folder of gcc compiler 
 *  in my case it was (C:\msys64\mingw64\include\isl)
 * 
 * step 2 : Save and refreash
 * 
 * step 3 : In C++ program which you want to use the fuction Use #include "phone.h"
 * 
 * step 4 : The funtion used to output the number is make_num($$); 
 * 			its a void function so no need to use cout it will automatically output 
 * 			We need to pass the starting two number of the phone number deafult its 99
 * 
 * ex : 
 * 			make_num(94);
 * 
 * output :  9434564776
